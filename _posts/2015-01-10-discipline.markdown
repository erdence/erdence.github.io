Discipline does not require any greater willpower than you already have. 

Discipline is budgeting your willpower to achieve maximum efficiency. Willpower, like rocket fuel, is used -- burned -- to exert force on yourself, thus changing your trajectory.

The way to your goals is filled with gravity wells : distractions, desires... dopamine wells. They attract you like black holes, bending the dopamine field. You must learn to reach your goals by navigating the dopamine field with precisely timed willpower burns.

Lack of discipline is not lack of willpower. It is suboptimal use of willpower by poor knowledge of the dopamine field and the derived equations of orbital mechanics. The farthest journeys into space are not made with the largest ships. They are made with the best timing, both of the launch and of the burns, to make optimal use of the surrounding gravity fields and wells. 

Similarly, dopamine wells are something you fall into, something you waste precious willpower burning away from, or something you can use, with short, carefully-timed burns, to slingshot yourself ever further towards your most ambitious goals.
