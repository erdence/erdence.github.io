title: The problem with anarchism

The problem with anarchism is that it relies on the higher brain. The dynamics of the nationstate politics rely heavily on the lower brains. I can easily imagine that even if today anarchism became instantly the norm, it would only be a matter of years before nationstates reappeared. Indeed, even if the entire population were comprised of people of the highest education, culture and morality, it would still be very much vulnerable to fear, pride and jealousy. They give rise to the desire to hurt others, which is something that the so-called enlightened humanist vigorously condemns. Which is why this same individual will leap at the occasion to create a set of artificial power structures that will allow him to distance himself and his actions from his own accountability and conscience. The man who orders to kill does not need to do the killing. There is another man, far away, who takes the order and is able to kill without hesitation, because authority has and always will trump morality.
