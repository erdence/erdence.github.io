It's a pleasure to see the tribe assembled. *(audience cheers)*

When we look at our own psychedelic experience, it seems so personally huge that it's very hard to place it in the context of hundreds of thousands of such experiences, but when we do that, when we look at the medical research that was carried on until it was suppressed some twenty years ago, the feeling that you come away with is: psychedelics dissolved boundaries. This is what they do. They dissolve boundaries at every level. The dissolve boundaries between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind, between men and women, between various societies and points of view. At one time, I was willing to let it rest at that, to imagine that these things are boundary-dissolving, structure-dissolving compounds, and this is what gives them their enormous import, because they lead us outside of the theater of language and into the real world that we suppressed in the process of becoming acculturated to our own culture. But now I thought more deeply about this and I think we can say more about this phenomenon of boundary dissolution, because the most profound boundary that any of us experiences is the boundary between ego and world. 1:52
