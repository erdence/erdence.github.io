My name is Terence McKenna and my training is basically in shamanism and botany and ethnography and my interest is in hallucinogenic drugs, especially plant hallucinogens as they're used in a shamanic context and what impels me to speak to a room full of people like this is the belief that the major important point regarding hallucinogens has been largely overlooked even though we're now 15 or 20 or 30 -- depending on how you count it -- years into the psychedelic age. The central point about the psychedelic experience is the content of the experience, and this has been occluded or obvuscated by the behavioral and statistical and scientific methods that have been brought to bear to study hallucinogenic experience. What I'm going to address this evening is essentially my own experience with hallucinogens and how I extrapolated into the world based on its own being and other people's psychedelic experiences that I have interacted with. Before I get into that, I want to clarify something about shamanism. There are two schools about the basis of shamanism, shamanistic experience. One is the oldest school exemplified by Mircea Elida, who holds that all narcotic shamanism is decadent. He prefers drumming, dancing, self-mutilation, even ordeal poisons, all precede the efficacy of hallucinogens. He believes they are resorted to when the tradition is vitiated and people are grasping at straws. I take this to be simply a cultural bias of the school of anthropology that he exemplified and the time in which his work was done. Now, Gordon Wasson has taken the opposite tack and takes the position that non-narcotic shamanism is decadent, because it is on its way to becoming ritual. In other words, drumming, fasting, flagellation, all these things work to a degree and sometimes. They are not dependable in the same way that hallucinogens are, and this plays on Western people's biases in favor of the idea that you have to work hard to get somewhere, and if you don't work hard it isn't useful. My own experience in looking at non-narcotic shamanism -- in Indonesia in Nepal -- was that while Wasson's intuition was very correct. There is a grasping after, and I see that grasping after blending into the evolution of all higher religions. In other words, experientially, there is only one religion and it is shamanism and shamanic ecstasy. But, it is very difficult to maintain in an agrarian context. Hunting and gathering societies, which have much less structured social hierarchies, seem to be able to function with the hallucinogenic experience embedded in them. As soon as you rise even to the level of primitive agriculturalists it becomes much more important to be able to get up in the morning and go to work than it does to have these ecstatic experiences, because the plants have to be tended, the fields tilled and so on. I formed these opinions about non-narcotic shamanism early in my career of looking at this phenomenon. I didn't contact narcotic shamanism until I went to the Amazon Basin initially in 1971 and although I was familiar with the hallucinogenic state from growing up basically in the counterculture in Berkeley, but what I found in South America after sifting through these various experiences is that the family of drugs constellated around tryptophan, specifically DMT dimethyltryptamine and psilocybin, which is chemically very similar to DMT, that these compounds had a relationship to reality far different from all the other hallucinogens. The scopolamine hyoscyamine tropane family that you get in datura and that kind of thing or LSD, which laboratory LSD does not occur in nature but I isomers of it occur in Nature, although to be taken at hallucinogenic doses, they must be taken at hundreds of times the amount. 

That's basically the scientific medical anthropological basis of what I'm saying. A career span in Asia and more recently in the Amazon, looking at this phenomenon. I wanted to take my conclusions tonight and contrast them with the modern predicament and try to make a model using the hallucinogenic experience. A model that makes some of the anxieties of being human and especially some of the anxieties of being human in the 20th century context, more palatable. To do that, I want to evoke a number of abysses, a number of empty places that our minds tend normally to shy away from. First to invoke them and then to integrate them through the idea of what is conventionally called the UFO experience. These abysses are basically four embedded in a fifth. The four are: the biological abyss that is represented by death and dying, that is the the central crisis of every individual existence, and almost as a reflection of that crisis on a higher plane, the historical abyss, represented by the end of History and the apocalypse and possibly the millennium. But in any case, the end of history that western religion, whether it be Judaism Christianity or whatever, has appointed to our world and made basic to Western man's view of things, and which now -- because of the existence of nuclear weapons and this kind of thing -- poses at terminal threat to the culture. Two abysses: the biological and the historical, the latter being symbolized in the apocalyptic crisis. The third abyss could be called the psychological and this is represented by dreams most in general experience and by hallucinogens. It is this casting off from the moorings of the ego, making the night sea journey into the Other and being at the mercy of the collective unconscious, the Overmind of the species, what have you. The fourth abyss which is one whose emergence is unique in our time is the actual physical abyss which surrounds this planet for lightyears in all directions, because suddenly now, because of our level of technology and and scientific mapping, we realize that it is there, and we realize that it is a source of our cosmic loneliness, and we realize that it presents an immense challenge of the sort we like to accept as a Western culture. Challenges of energy engineering and distance. These are the four abysses. The abyss of space, the abyss of death, the abyss of the psychedelic experience and the abyss of dying. These four general categories have to be seen embedded in a somewhat subtler kind of abyss which is the abyss of the unspeakable, in other words that language which is the primary of cognition of the species, cast nets against these other gulfs and comes away with different kinds of maps, but you cannot put much trust in these maps unless you've carried out a thorough analysis of language, and once you've done that for sure you will not put much trust in any of these maps because the thinness of the web on which it all is hung will be readily apparent. 

My assumption whenever I am confronted with opposites is to try to unify them, to create a coincidentia oppositorum, as was done in alchemy, to not force the system to closure, but to try and leave the system open enough so that these differences can resonate and become complementary rather than antithetical. I would like to unify here not two dualisms but these four opposed, these pairs, you could think of them as the quadripartite elements of a kind of mandalas. 

The means to unifying that mandala is integration of the psychedelic experience, specifically, I'm going to make the assumption specifically the psilocybin or tryptamine experience and what it appears to be is something which is much more assimilable to the science-fiction metaphor of a parallel universe than it is to the Freudian metaphor of the repression of desire or even the Jungian metaphor of a collective species-wide memory and experience bank. It is much more of the character of a parallel continuum, and in order to erect the intellectual edifice of these past thousand years, this possibility has had to be ignored, much in the way that you would apply Occam's razor to a situation and just say well we will not admit the more complex phenomenon because we should form a theory that is true to the simplest phenomena first, and then build out from it, and this has worked in a demonic kind of way, in the sense that we have taken command of the of the atomic world which is a very simple world compared for instance to the variables that you meet in sociology or biology, but at the cost of formulating theories about how the world is put together that nowhere come tangential to experience. We have a bizarre situation where our best models of reality that are kept for us by the priesthood of science are like exhibits in a museum because they cannot be mapped onto the simple fact of the individual experience. Shamanism on the other hand is this worldwide since paleolithic times tradition, which says that you must make your own experience the centerpiece of any model of the world that you build. No amount of readings from meters, whether they are meters in cyclotrons or any other kind of instrument, are going to to satisfy you. Once you understand that, then what the task becomes is one of making sense of these metaphors so called or myths so called that are the pre-Western, pre-print, pre-literate mappings of the world. An example of how this problem distorts other problems is the problem of extraterrestrial contact, which is -- the way science presents the problem of extraterrestrial contact is that we are alone, and that to assuage our cosmic loneliness we should build a larger radio telescopes and million channel signal analyzers and sift the radio noise coming from the stars and eventually if a signal is found, an immense philosophical turning point will have occurred and we will then place ourselfs in the context of the cosmis. This is actually a red herring type of argument, because outside of the highly technical western societies that have evolved in the last three hundred years, people have been talking to the Other since Man began. Angels, demons, fairies, sprites, elves, all of this is as phenomenologically a part of human experience as -- we'll say -- birds of paradise, which I'm sure none of you have ever had anything to do with, but believe inflexibly that such creatures exist because it is allowed by the experts that exist. What psilocybin focuses as a problem that these other hallucinogens do not, is that it allows a dialog with the Other that is full of give-and-take. In other words, there are entities in the hallucinogenic world that psilocybin and DMT and a few other not well known or widely distributed plant hallucinogens induce. 

I think it was William Blake who said: "The truth cannot be told so as to be understood without being believed." This is the kind of information that is coming through the psilocybin experience. It is information which you have to believe. You have to believe it because it has this ring of authenticity. It is the logos, it is the Word somehow, and what is being said is that our alienation -- and this word is interesting, alienation -- our alienation from ourselves has caused us to set up a number of strawmen that are keeping us from building a mature model of how the universe really works. The content of the dialog with the Other is a content that indicates that man's horizons are infinitely bright, that death, as Thomas Vaughn puts it: "The body is the placenta of the soul." This fact has not yet been assimilated because it runs counter to Western reductionist materialist empiricism, but this idea that the body is placenta to the soul is not an object of faith or of dogma, it's a program for activity. The activity that it implies should be undertaken, is a familiarization with the soul, and the soul has been banned from Western thinking about the self for nigh four hundred years, at least in leading circles, but I take this concept very seriously, and I think if any of you are familiar with the literature of alchemy, alchemy is about the generation of a psychic construct, a wholeness, a thing which has many properties, which is paradoxical, which is both mind and matter, which can do anything. This is the last gasp of the soul before it submerged completely, in other words it became trapped in an association with phonic matter in the last historical epoch before it disappeared completely from Western consciousness. Psychedelic drugs -- especially psilocybin -- allow a searchlight to be thrown on these deeper levels of the psyche as Jung correctly stated, but it is not a museum of archetypes or psychic constructs as he seemed to assume. It is a frontier of wholeness into which any person so motivated and so courageous as to wish to do it, can go and leave the mundane plane far behind. In other words, it isn't dimension of vertical gain that is real and is present in all of our lives and that we do not acknowledge except as an anomaly because we have been told that it's an anomaly. We have been told that these perceptions have to be devalued. The result of this is to so distort the psychic life of the species in the present historical context, that we have this UFO disease, which is essentially a rupture into three-dimensional space of this archetype of wholeness and it haunts time like a ghost, and it haunts human experience in the 20th century, because it is a symbol of alienation, and the word alien has in fact come to be applied to this thing. It is alien, it comes from the stars, it is totally non-human, it has great potential for mankind but it can barely be Englished at all. Actually, what it is, is the Self in the form which is most accessible to the ego, given the ego's programming with all the scientific garbage about the density of life in the universe, the distance to the stars, the probability of chemical evolution occurring here and there and yonder. It is in other words something which in order not to alarm us has disguised itself as an extraterrestrial being, but is in fact the collectivity of the human psyche signaling a profound historical crisis. 

I talked about this before. I talked about the danger of succumbing to belief in UFOs because of the damage it did to free will and that, yes, the UFO is making war on science because science has created such a masculine overbalance in the intellectual life of the species that this automatic mechanism has been triggered. A history-stopping archetype is being released into the skies of this planet and if we are not careful it will halt all intellectual inquiry in the same way that the Christos archetype halted intellectual inquiry in the Hellenistic age. I don't want to go into this too deeply, but it's clear to me that Hellenistic science was destroyed by the Christos archetype because the Democretian atomists and materialists who ran Roman civilization had no patience whatsoever with this superstition that was being circulated among the servants about a man who rose from the dead and all that went with it, but before they knew what had happened, their whole civilization was in ruin because the archetype had frozen the forward thrust of this masculine-dominant, ethically-depotentiated, technologically-obsessed, slave-built society and a thousand years, hydrostatics, mathematics, metallurgy, you name it -- that was nothing. Only the words of one Galilean radical could occupy the time of any intellectual successfully. We have now, 2000 years later, fought our way somewhat clear of that problem, but the problem it solved which is the problem of this masculine overbalance and this obsessive technological thrust, this dehumanizing thrust has reached an even more intense peak, and now appears the flying saucer with the capacity of undoing that, by again destroying science by simply being a miracle. That's all that is required to wreck science, is a miracle visible worldwide, and because scientists say that that can't happen. Consequently, if it does happen, their house is in real disorder.

-- stop --

 so I touched on this before any of you tonight I want to talk more about the flying saucer not from the point of view of the people who are going to get the Miami cheers but from the point of view of an insider in other words one can do more visibly manifest in the skies were due to his street toward an eschatological mode that will stifle inquiry in order basically to preserve the species from extinction but humanity could get into a place where we no longer required these metaphysical spanking and flying saucer he's come along every thousand years 60 to mask the mask that has been created and another tax and the way to do this is to look at the abyss and try to unify and I think that still sign off the way out because it allows for mind that is not you won't read about it in Scientific American or anywhere else you will carry it out and the carrying out of this dialogue will place will essentially eschatology eyes you as a person and lift you out of the historical context it's like Stefan Daedalus ulysses history is the nightmare that I am trying to await the turn around and say history is what I am trying to go to sleep from in order to get away from in other words the dream is illogical the dream time and outside if history is state into the dream but he charged against these drugs they are APIs I think the people who make this charge hardly dared dream from the plan and from the problem if possible of the unspeakable this a bit about death and dying if you leave aside the last 300 years of historical experiences it was handled in Europe and America and examine the phenomenon of death the doctrine of the soul its ramifications platonic Christian dynastic Egyptian etcetera all of these what you get is the idea that there is a light body or intellectually that is somehow mixed up in the body during life and death dying is involved in a crisis in which these two envelopes and one loses its raison d'etre falls into dissolution metabolism stocks and the other one goes we know not where perhaps if you believe it doesn't exist but then you have the problem of trying to explain life which by the way the science makes claims and has done very well in systems of nuclear particles and even simple atomic systems the idea that science can make any statement about what life is where it comes from a science has nothing to say about how you can decide close your hand into a fist and it happened early outside the realm of scientific explanation because what we see him that phenomenon is mind as a first cause in other words we seem to matter it's an example telekinesis matter is caused by mind to move so science had we need not fear the sneers of Science in the matter of the soul my thrust into this has always been my experience that I've been thinking recently more about because dreams are a much more generalized form of experience the hyper dimension or the the mode in in which life and mind and looking at dreams and looking at what people shamanic traditions thing about dreams you come to the realization that experience in his a parallel continuum the shaman or other things which I mentioned but most efficacious but everybody else access through dreams dreams was the German term but he called dangerous he always felt that you could trace the content of the dream down to a distortion of something that happened during the day or during waking time I think that it's much more useful to try and make actually a kind of geometric model of consciousness and to take seriously the idea of a parallel continuum and to say that the mind and the body are embedded in the dream and the dream is kind kind of higher spatial dimension in sleep you are released into the real world which the world of waiting is only the surface and in a very a very literal sense the surface in a geometric that there is the plan and this is a holographic planning information information all information where information that is not here is no and that information and outside of historical time it's like Plato's time is the movie does not have a temporal existence even the kind of temporal existence where you say it always existed it does not have temporal duration of any sort it is eternity we are not we are not primarily biology with mind emerging as a kind of the higher levels of organization of biology we are in fact hyper dimensional option of some sort which cast a shadow into matter and the matter the shadow in May matter is the body and and death what happens basically is that the shadow withdraws or the thing which casts a shadow with drugs and metabolism ceases and matter which had been organized into a dissipative structure in a very localized area sustaining itself by cycling materially integrating and expelling it that whole phenomenon pieces but the order did is not affected by that and when I i make these declarative statements I'm making them from the point of view of the shimon tradition which you touches all these higher everything except rationalism holes to some version of what I'm saying so then the psychedelic the dream state and in a psychedelic State Choir great import because they there is then a task to life and the task to life is to become familiar with this thing which is causing the and to be familiar with it at the moment of passing in other words that the metaphor is used to buy certain traditions of the vehicle and after death the astral body something like that and shamanism and certainly helped Dallas still get claim very clearly that the purpose is to familiarize yourself with this after death body in life and then the active dying will not create confusion key you will recognize what is happening you will know what to do and you will make the claim break and there does seem to be the possibility of a problem in dying in other words what I'm telling you it's not that you're condemned to eternal life I'm saying it's a possibility that you can muscle through it in other words at the moment of death there is a kind of separation it's like birth but perfect it is there is a possibility damage incorrect activity it said that as you start into the spiral there is the possibility of falling from the golden track into eternal death but it is only a crisis of the moment it's a crisis of passage and the whole purpose of shamanism and of life correctly lived is to strengthen the soul to strengthen the relationship to the soul so that this this passage can be cleanly main anything it's well-known it's a traditional actually but now I want to assimilate one more abyss into this model and less one less familiar to us as rationalist but well familiar to us just one level deeper in the psyche as Christians and western areas and that is this idea that the world will and that there will be a final time that there is not only the crisis the death of the individual there is a crisis the death of the species what this is about is that from the time that there is an awareness of the existence of the soul 50,000 BPD Intel the resolution of the apocalyptic potential and there's something like fifty thousand years which in biological time is only a moment but it is the entire span of history times in that period everything hangs in the balance because it is a mad rush a month keep them to starship hood and in the leap across the US twenty-five thousand years energy serving least religions are shot off like sparks a lot of things in fall and die science arises matching all of these things which control power with greater and lesser degrees here there is the possibility as in the metaphor of dying there is the possibility of mucking it up aborting the species transformation into a hyper spatial intellect we are now there can be no doubt that we are now in the final seconds of that crisis a crisis which in the end of history the departure from the planet the triumph over death and the release of the individuals from matter we are in fact closing distance with the most profound event to planetary geology can encounter which is the free from the dark chrysalis matter the old metaphor of psyche yes the butterfly is a species why we must undergo a metamorphosis in order to survive the momentum of the historical forces already in motion well if you know anything about evolutionary biology you know that man is considered to be an evolving sometime in the last hundred thousand years with the invention of culture the biological evolution of man ceased and evolution became a cultural phenomenon tools languages and philosophies began to fall but the human somewhat I begin to remain the same and hands of the people along time ago but technology is the real skin of our species man correctly seen in the context of the last 500 years is an industry leader of the technological she'll be taken matter that is has a low degree of organization we put it through mental filters and leaks true Lindisfarne Gospels space shuttles are like coral and technological extremely did and the tool is a flying saucer or the sole exterior eyes and three dimensional spaces as James Joyce said it's the problem of how man made the dirigible right and how man maybe dirigible is basically by turning himself inside out in other words the body must become an interior I stole a dramatic got Chi embedded in solid-state hyper dimensional matrix which is eternal so that man wanders in his body islamic paradise wanders to release his body experience the pleasures of the flesh but not realizing that he is a holographic projection of a solid state matrix that is micro miniaturized superconducting and nowhere to be found it is part of the plan and we all history is about producing prototypes of this situation with greater and greater closure touring the ideal so that airplanes automobiles condominium space shuttles space colony star ships of the hardware speed of life's been dizzy drive type all of these are as mushy Leonsis self transforming images a flight that speak volumes about mass aspiration to self transcendence so that we are our live sharks and our only hope basically is to end the historical by becoming the alien by ending alienate I recognize the alien as the cells that recognize in the alien and Andover mind which holds all the physical laws of the planet in fact in the same way that you hold an idea intact and your mind in other words all these things which are thought to be so written anime teen are actually merely the moon's the god if you will which we happen to be and the whole thing about human history is recovering this piece and lost information so that man may be der trouble getting in some way white cane is the red light district of Dublin here in my cane reflect on the seamy side but at the end prospects are you worried and you will so if you want to be thing comin be parked it's not what it takes to be part of blessing in disguise point out and where I think society will kill once they are integrated to the point where large groups of people plan research programs without fear of being persecuted for it is it models the after death state it may do more than model it it may essentially reveal the nature of it that our mind what we each call our mind can be the modalities appearance in understanding him be shifted so that we see it within the context of the one mind and and problems like the existence becomes trivial because one mind that I'm talking about contain all experienced Tony in the universe deployed throughout the park sex and killing dozens of physical space and the interior mental universe the same thing we perceive them as unresolvable to listen to what I call it the quality of the code meaning the language we use to discuss this problem has built-in dualism this is a problem of language codes have code qualities except the logos the logos and therefore heartaches and no quality other than itself but someone issue deals among issue with something other than the locals there will be closed qualities and the dualism built in to our language makes the death of the species these seem to be opposed things likewise the problems biology and extrapolation XO biology posed by examining the first says the angel and demon haunted world that depth psychology is reporting on its again dichotomy all go beyond an academic understanding of what I've been saying is to have the experience of this tryptamine induce text you see in other words for reasons which I need to my brother the tryptamine molecule has this unique property of releasing the structure itself into herself and experience those and many epochal it's a meanie entry and mapping into hyperspace for society to change in this direction nothing is necessary for this experience to become an object general concern now I'm not saying everybody should rush out and take mushroom in case you thought that's what I am saying that these deals with information which I don't know if you're like me that my experience of these things is basically litter I read play time I read direct flight is read all this stuff and I try to integrate it intellectually but it is a plane of the experience that is directly accessible and the role that we plays in relationship to it determines how we will present ourselves in the final transformation that this him in other words in this period there is a teleological bias there is the police the Darius hyper out she called the Overmind or what have you that casts a shadow into time and history is the experience of the shadow and they should draw closer to the source of the shadow the paradoxes the rate of change change intensive the because what is happening is that this hyper object is beginning to impress into three-dimensional space one way of thinking of it is that the train and the waking world in the world of the dream begin to become one so that the school of flying saucer criticism at flying saucer hallucinations within a certain sense in that the laws which operate in the dream the laws which operate in hyperspace times operate in three-dimensional space when the barrier between the two Mullins becomes weak and then you have these curious experiences sometimes called psychotic breaks sometimes call her that which always have a tremendous impact on the person because there seems to be an exterior compliment that could not possibly be mental this is what I'm talking about is incidents again to bill bill bill until you finally say you know I don't know what is going on but it's preposterous claim that this is a psychological phenomenon because these are changes in the world when young call synchronicity and made a certain model of what it really is an alternative physics is beginning to impinge on on reality and it is the physics of light essentially light is composed of all time photons have no anti party this means that there is no in the world of light and if you try to imagine the experience have you made it sound like you realize I'm sure with the conventions of relativity which same time slows down as you approach the speed of light but what is never said about that is that if you move at the speed of light there is no time whatsoever there is an experience of times so if you imagine for a moment yourself to be made of life or in possession of the vehicle which can look at the speed of light you can't reverse any point in the universe with a subjective experience times this means that you crossed the center times but the amount of time that has passed in the relativistic universe is whatever it is and a half years but very great distances thousand light-years across to Andromeda you still experience times the only experience of time that you have is the subjective time that is created by your own mentation but in relationship to the so-called newtonian universe there is no time whatsoever you exist in eternity you have become eternal now of course the universe is aging at a staggering around you and the situation but you perceived it as fact the universe the way we perceive his success of this universe you have essentially translated into this eternal that I mentioned time as the moving image of eternity you wear them away from the movie and this phone I believe that this is what technology pushes toward and that there is no opposition between you know illogical balance and the people who want to leave the planet and the hyper technologists and the high-flying natural all of these are red herrings the real historical entity which is becoming imminent is the human soul and it is the multibody has served to carry to this moment of release and it will always as a yes but it will exist in a world made by the human imagination this is what the returning to the Father the transcendence of prices the rising out of the Gnostic universe survived that tracks the lyle enforce it means release into the human imagination very shortly game as it were this phenomenon will take place in the form of space exploration and space colonies because they're the coral reef like animal called man that has extreme did technology all over the surface of the earth will be free at last from the constraints and anything but his own imagination and the limitations of materials so that for instance the earliest space colonies of course there will be an effort to duplicate the system and the sense that you know these like exercises and technological understanding to prove you know what you're doing but as soon as this is under control we will be released into the realm of art we will make our world a world and the worldly came from will be maintained his garden but indicated as these endless metaphors itself transforming flight will be realized momentarily and the technology of the space colony what is lining up right behind that is the fact that the transition to space is a staggering tight genetics filter a much tighter guilty than any previous frontier even the the genetic demographic filter represented by the New World the vitality of america is because only dream the pioneers and the trip across the chance to shine to space and the technological ton Christmas will set the stage then for the interior is stationed and the contrast in space and the collapse of the state vectors in space and then man will have become more than dirt shuffle questions technology in which structure in such a way in such a way that you begin to get a readout on the structure is the sole in other words this was an effort to use the kind of shamanic technology to hang a superconducting telemetry cited le device on the Overmind so that they would be a continuous readout of information and the success or failure of this you may judge reading book describes the experiment theoretical underpinning of the experiment the second half of the book describes the theory of the structure of time that derived from the bizarre mental states that followed up on the experiment I don't claim we succeeded I just claim that our theory of what happened is better than you but whether we succeeded or not that kind of thinking points the way in other words when I see when I speak of the technology of building the starship I imagine it will be done teaches the low voltage of the common flashlight battery this is where the voltages where the most interesting phenomenon you'll want in nature thought is that kind of phenomenon metabolism is that kind of phenomenon so I think this clarion science science place psychedelic experience at the center of its program nation should be should move toward a practical realization of this goal goal of eliminating the barrier between the EU and the over yourself so that the ego and perceive itself as an expression of the over yourself so then the anxiety of being cast into matter apparently facing a tremendous biological crisis in the form of death facing a tremendous physical species crisis in the form of the apocalypse the crisis limitation in space by the planet found all of these things and be obviated by cultivating the sole basically by practicing shamanism using these tryptamine drugs described and my two scientists administrators and politicians who may be listening to my choice is to look at at silicide to not month it with the other psychedelics to realize that it is a phenomenon unto itself and it has an enormous potential for transforming mankind not simply transforming the people who take it but it is like an art movement or a mathematical understanding or a scientific breakthrough it holds the possibility of transforming entire society by virtue of the information that is coming through this and the voice for at least a thousand years I like to think when these friends arrived in Mexico and 16th century they immediately set about camping this thing out the Indians called it TN on Cottle the flesh of the gods well the Catholic Church has a monopoly on your face and not by this particular approach to what was going on now 304 and I think that the heroes which retreated from Greece and retreated from Europe with the rise of Christianity be changed to the mountains and then finally pushed into seclusion there now re-emerges in western consciousness and our institutions all of these things are so shakily founded and so misconstrued with the help of shamanic inspired personalities weekend release thing once the loan those can be unleashed once spoke to Plato and Parmenides back to him speak again in the minds of modern people and when it does the alienation will be ended because we will have become the alien and this is this is the promise that and I realize that it may seem to some a nightmare but it is all historical changes I had that quality because they propel people into a completely new world yes discovering that in reality you want me to comment on that I agree with you that this is a strongly held position I always in my relations have recourse to my own experience and I've not had good luck with any of these text me I spent time in India practiced yoga scoured the various species ROS she's geisha is the day she had to offer and I believe they must be talking about something but it in my experience it is so far removed from the actual closure with the intense to me nice to see that I don't love it and I am willing to believe these things are possible I just must be a very grounded for instance claims to be that's what time is the shortcut and they might be on the right track sexuality orgasm these things do have tryptamine this qualities to them but the main thing about assignment and I stress is information immense in my experience like LSD the nation seemed largely to be somehow related to the structure of the optic nerve or they are essentially trivial they are geometric patterns but unless by another drug the classic psychedelic experience that started it all those people I believe 200 micrograms of LSD and 30 milligrams of mescaline and I would believe that that would deliver visionary experience the difference is but still is not colored lights and moving shows shoe laces jungles cities sheen's bullets architect of incredible complexity just click click click there is no possibility that this could be construed as fact the most highly ordered visual information that you ever experienced much more highly visual experience I'm having at this moment is this room no no I talked about this last time that finally today's talks about what he calls a more perfect logos he says some workers would be beheld rather then heard in other words the formulation you get in the Gospel of John Kerry d-mass the beginning was the Word yes in the beginning but this is a strange trying to forward it is the word which is officially be held and the language in which the Northeast communicates is a language of the issue such that there is no ambiguity about me because there is no recourse to a dictionary defines signification it is purely be held this is why it's very hard to bring that information because it is hard to English and the reason it's hard to me because it's like trying to make a three-dimensional rendering of a fourth dimensional object through the media can be perceived that's why it's so interesting and I should have maybe talk more about it that some assignment and ayahuasca which is this regional drug which uses tryptamine to make it run there's a telepathy which years there is a shared state of mind because the unfolding hallucination is shared in complete silence you know it's very hard to prove this to the scientists but if for people are having this experience you know one person can like monologue and then cease the monologue and another person will take everyone is seen and this is the quality of being visual information to answer your question arthur seems to make this logos believable in the way that I quoted William Blake when he said the truth cannot be told and you do believe you do believe it oh yeah I went home I would say this is the same other things without ever crossing and yet this seems impossible it seems illogical impossibility because it is either one or the other and yet when you actually have the experience you see it is thought becomes more and more intense until finally its intensity is such that with there being no jumper glitch you now holding it and this is very typical yes the body takes me a long time to experience and I feel you know I never have lost my respect for him and i really feel is one of the emotions I always feel as I approach because I have no faith that my sales won't be ripped this time I always make the medical sailing out onto it dark ocean and your little kid and you know you may use the moon rising severely a black water or something the size of freight train may roll through your scene clutching an or and I don't know astrology is may be helpful in figuring out when to go to go but there needs to be a way to figure out how your question about the dialogue I I need this very literally it speaks to you you speech to it is I don't know how many of you have read my book that my brother and I wrote under pseudonyms the magic mushroom grower sky introduction there there's a rap about old fifty times older than thought in your species and I came from the stars you know I just was writing it furiously and sometimes it's it's very human I mean my approach to it is great that we argue about what it's going to cost it is and I say well look you know I'm the girl or home to the flying saucer 45 minutes to figure out how it works sometimes like a very toned dick sort of pawn broker and I asked at one time what are you doing honor and it said well you know it's quiet neighborhood history is the shock wave of eschatology in other words we are living in a very unique moment twenty thousand years where this cements transition is happening and the object the end then beyond history which is the human species transformed into this eternal superconducting over Mainz space craft thing is casting a shadow of that through time and all religion philosophy all wars are because people do not get the message right and that's because both the forward flowing stream of the causal determinism and the interference pattern that is formed against them by the backward flowing fact of this eschatological hyper objet throwing its shadow across the landscape so we exist there is a great deal with this situation call history is totally in need will only last for a moment it will only last for a moment but in that moment there is like this tremendous burst static as the monkey goes to godhood and there is this crossing the day I don't like to call it because you a street but the efficacy of the eschaton this finalists illogical launching and forward flow and truck that circumstance get it for you maybe something to do with certainly life is necessary that like this we it is not the idea that we have been used to assign any assistance that are actually know this is a very important part of the cycle it is it is a filter remember a

we were able to which it has first and then is rather than able only to cast a shadow into files seized reflection and I don't come very close hear classical millinery and the libertarian thought my you love the rate at which change is accelerating and the way the giant is tightening causes me to think and the wave predicts this that it is not law it is 25 years 30 years then this event will
