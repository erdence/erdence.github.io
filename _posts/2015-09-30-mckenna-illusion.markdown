What I wanted to talk about is illusions. I called the lecture the Taxonomy of Illusion, because I think it's interesting to attempt to classify and relate the various kinds of illusions that stand between us and that presupposed naked, radiant truth -- *(As if on cue, [a larsen echo](https://youtu.be/_PuyoHH4c70?t=1m50s) surges through the speakers. All laugh.)* -- that has more or less drive the engines of Western philosophy since Plato.

Of course, the great victory of modernity is to disabuse ourselves of such naive notions but they die hard I think. Ralph mentioned my latest book and I don't intend to talk abou tthe book pparticulary, but in the book I quote the only piece of poetry in the whole thing not written by me. It relates to this on many many levels, this question of illusion and the relatiohsip of the self to the real and where the world falls in that equation, and the limits of knowledge, and all that other good psychedelic stuff that needs to be considered. The quote is from Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, and if you don't know this book, you should. It is without doubt one of the funniest books in the english language, and it takes the form of a very long poem, and then the commentary upon this poem. The poem is written by a characted that Nabokov creates named John Shade.

That rare phenomenon
The iriduleâ€”when, beautiful and strange,
In a bright sky above a mountain range
One opal cloudlet in an oval form
Reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm
Which in a distant valley has been staged
For we are most artistically caged

This is a very strange piece of poetry. This is not even like Wallace Stevens at his most obscure. In the first place, this word -- the iridule. You won't find this word in any dictionary, and yet I sensed that this is obviously the word for this phenomenon. I know what he's talking about. I have seen this opal cloudlet in an oval form which reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm in a distant place. Here we are in the realm of mirage and Nature as mirage and as mirrored labyrinth. The final line about being artistically caged, this is I think where the psychedelics come in, becuase psychedelics allow one to pierce beyond the veil of cultural illusion, beyond the linguistic momentum of what has been handed on.

The faith of Tantra and magic and psychedelics is that the apparent intransigent appearance of the world can somehow be overcome by an act of magic. I used to collect tibetan Tonkas, and the texts which go with some of these Tonkas, I remember one in particular: All things being reversed, the great God appears instantly. You see, the precondition for magic is the reversal of causality -- somehow. As moderns, we have grown to give great credence to the idea that the world is largely a linguisti cstructure, largely created theough the participation of the observef, but we have not been ale to take that perception and turn it into a technology. Instead, we are still driven by the blind momentum of atomic struture. 

Who is it that said "the atoms blindly run"? And then I think it was Whitehead who said "But in the body they run blindly according to the body's plan". What I think we're dealing with are patterns, and then the indeterminate dimensions between patterns. It's in those indeterminate places, within those interstices of reality that the observer is able to establish him or herself, and then model back the world. 

The reason I wanted to talk about a *taxonomy* of illusion, was because I thought it was important to relate the various styles of hyper-seeing, non-seeing and mis-seeing together, because I think that the heuristic consequences of doing that are to realize just how shifting the sands are upon which the ontological edifice of Western thinking rests. That's always the point, you see, to deconstruct Western civilization, because its toxic consequences are now clear for everyone to see.
