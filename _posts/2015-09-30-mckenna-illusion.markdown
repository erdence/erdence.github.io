What I wanted to talk about is illusions. I called the lecture the Taxonomy of Illusion, because I think it's interesting to attempt to classify and relate the various kinds of illusions that stand between us and that presupposed naked, radiant truth -- *(As if on cue, [a larsen echo](https://youtu.be/_PuyoHH4c70?t=1m50s) surges through the speakers. All laugh.)* -- that has more or less drive the engines of Western philosophy since Plato.

Of course, the great victory of modernity is to disabuse ourselves of such naive notions but they die hard I think. Ralph mentioned my latest book and I don't intend to talk abou tthe book pparticulary, but in the book I quote the only piece of poetry in the whole thing not written by me. It relates to this on many many levels, this question of illusion and the relatiohsip of the self to the real and where the world falls in that equation, and the limits of knowledge, and all that other good psychedelic stuff that needs to be considered. The quote is from Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, and if you don't know this book, you should. It is without doubt one of the funniest books in the english language, and it takes the form of a very long poem, and then the commentary upon this poem. The poem is written by a characted that Nabokov creates named John Shade.

That rare phenomenon
The iriduleâ€”when, beautiful and strange,
In a bright sky above a mountain range
One opal cloudlet in an oval form
Reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm
Which in a distant valley has been staged
For we are most artistically caged

This is a very strange piece of poetry. This is not even like Wallace Stevens at his most obscure. In the first place, this word -- the iridule. You won't find this word in any dictionary, and yet I sensed that this is obviously the word for this phenomenon. I know what he's talking about. I have seen this opal cloudlet in an oval form which reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm in a distant place. Here we are in the realm of mirage and Nature as mirage and as mirrored labyrinth. The final line about being artistically caged, this is I think where the psychedelics come in, becuase psychedelics allow one to pierce beyond the veil of cultural illusion, beyond the linguistic momentum of what has been handed on.

The faith of Tantra and magic and psychedelics is that the apparent intransigent appearance of the world can somehow be overcome by an act of magic. I used to collect tibetan Tonkas, and the texts which go with some of these Tonkas, I remember one in particular: All things being reversed, the great God appears instantly. You see, the precondition for magic is the reversal of causality -- somehow. As moderns, we have grown to give great credence to the idea that the world is largely a linguisti cstructure, largely created theough the participation of the observef, but we have not been ale to take that perception and turn it into a technology. Instead, we are still driven by the blind momentum of atomic struture. 

Who is it that said "the atoms blindly run"? And then I think it was Whitehead who said "But in the body they run blindly according to the body's plan". What I think we're dealing with are patterns, and then the indeterminate dimensions between patterns. It's in those indeterminate places, within those interstices of reality that the observer is able to establish him or herself, and then model back the world. 

The reason I wanted to talk about a *taxonomy* of illusion, was because I thought it was important to relate the various styles of hyper-seeing, non-seeing and mis-seeing together, because I think that the heuristic consequences of doing that are to realize just how shifting the sands are upon which the ontological edifice of Western thinking rests. That's always the point, you see, to deconstruct Western civilization, because its toxic consequences are now clear for everyone to see. 

The first category or grand family of illusions which we would put into our taxonomic key would be **social illusions**. At this point in the discussion, illusion is "slash-" delusion, so the great social illusions/delusions are sexism, racism, xenophobia, egoism, classism. The world is riddled and ruled by the social illusions, and no-one is free of them. They consitute one broad category.

I might just mention as an aside, a book -- which was very influential on me and I've never heard anybody else ever mention it -- by Rocliffe called Illusions and Delusions of the Supernatural and the Occult. This was a 19th century book that I as a kid got in a Dover reprint, and it was in a wonderful era where the study of anomalies was still young, so this book has everything poured in together from Mesmer's ectoplasm to people who has tumors that they carried around in wheelbarrows, to birds that did advanced arithmetic, etc. It was very much from the point of view of Victorian Rationalism, and it also mentioned psychedelics. What it really was, was a catalog of *edges*. It's only then, in the subsequent 35 years, that that wunderkammer approach to illusion. By wunderkammer I'm referring to era before the rise of Linnaen natural science, where naturalists would simply fill cabinets with anomalous fascinating and strange objects, so the tarantulas might be mixed in with the chambered nautiluses, which might be stirred into the Zuni fetishes. Later, these wunderkammer -- curiosity cabinets in English -- gave way to Linnean taxonomy. In the same way, over the past 100 years, the study of illusion and anomaly has attempted to rationalize itself. 

Spatial illusions are an entirely different family of illusory phenomena. We all have encountered at some level the specially-constructed environments that occur in behavioral psyhcology labs that trick you into thinking that the person in the foreground is smaller than the person in the background, etc. These kinds of illusions are probably fairly trivial, except that the address perception, and when we get to psychedelics as a source of illusion, this is more important.

Another great family of illusions is ontological illusions. Illusions of states of being, which may or may not in fact be reflected in reality. UFOs, Bigfoot, crop circles, the entire panoply of poltergeist phenomena. Ontological illusions. These are very interesting, and one could give time to this alone, because there are *persistent* ontological illusions in the human sensorium, such as angels, elves, demons, djinns, [afrits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit), nixies and sprites, that crowd. There are ontological illusions that seem tied to the evolving modalities of the group mind. UFOs are an obvious example. Aside from the fact that people have occasionally seen strange things in the sky, the UFO archetype really emerges in the late 1940's with the Rainier lights, and a whole set of taxonomic features of this particular brand of illusion coalesce: the silvery discs, the alien denizens with the cat eyes and the rubbery flesh, those same guys who give you unscheduled proctological examinations in the middle of the night. *(audience laughs*) Notice that that particular taxonomic feature has been added recently through the assiduously careful scientific research of Strieber and co. Cattle mutilation is an interesting one. Very confined in time and space. Crop circles, similarly. It's not that there aren't crop circles, but that what we have is essentially a pattern in an English wheat field, but then radiating out from that are the illusions of those who cast their gaze upon it, those who proclaim it telluric communication or particle beam research carried on by the Air Force. In one version, it was supposed that a particular crop circle had been decoded and found to be a lost sumerian language which when decoded said basically "Don't stop here." It was essentially a no-parking zone for time machines -- "This entire century, just maintain speed and do not stop!'.

Psychedelic illusions -- again, this is related category but different from these ontological illusions. By illusion, I mean that these are confrontations with phenomena, an apparently subjective and an assumed rational observer, where there is a more-than-ordinary amount of ambiguity. I mean, **most of reality is illusory, it's just that we do each other the courtesy of not pointing this out**. Actually, you trace a very thin data path through the world, and most of what we assume without question, we have very little evidence for. Something as simple as: "Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world." First of all, very few people have ever seen it. I saw it, and because I saw it from a distance of about 500 miles, it looked quite small. My own testimony as to whether it was the highest mountain in the world would be fairly unreliable. Besides, what does that mean anyhow, and how the hell do you figure it out? Here, you have one mountain in the Himalayas and another in Bolivia, and you're telling me you know which is the higher mountain? It must rest on a whole bunch of weird and fishy assumptions, resting on even shakier data, and that's just the questions of the highest mountain in the world, let alone the state of your lover's heart -- or your banker's, for that matter.

What's important about the psychedelic family of illusions is that they propel the entire issue of illusion to center stage, because they demonstrate that the assumed bedrock of "ordinary perception" is in fact no bedrock at all. It's simply a very soft dwell-point somewhere in the mysteries of metabolism. Consciousness, whatever its relationship to the brain, is spectaculary affected by the perturbation of the physical brain by exogenously introduced pseudo-neurotransmitters. Alexander Shulgin has secured in his work that you can take a molecule that is completely inactive, and by moving one atom to a different place on the ring, you can change this into a psychoactive compound. You could hardly have a neater demonstration of the quantum-mechanical foundation of consciousness, because you've moved one atom and you've moved the mountains of mind five hundred miles from where they were resting when last you looked. It's quite spectacular. It argues then, that mind which -- Strangely enough, the materialists always claim this, they just put different emphasis on the words. Mind is a kind of iridescence upon metabolism. For the materialists, that was a dismissal, because to them what iridescence meant was a tertiary phenomnenan not inimical to the structure of matter but necessarily perceived only through the intercession of an observer. It's somehow a more fragile part of Nature than the rocks, the trees and the waters, because it's a play between light and mind. Again, a kind of illusion, a mirage.

In a very different category of illusion -- and this is one worth considering because it 21:19
