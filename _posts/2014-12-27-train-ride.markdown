And then, just then, I understood the Truth. What they were all on about. What they are all saying, without ever saying it. What they were showing through their actions and their creations. I understood who was actually in charge, here.

I understood that the power of the work of Edward Bernays was directly linked to the work of Charles F. Haanel, and of Jung, and probably all the way back to Kant. What is now called the Right Brain, Flow, or Imagination, I understood the Sea of the Unconscious. The theory that encompassed all theories. The metaphor that bound all metaphors. The wave of meaning that contained all frequencies.

I understood what Jony Ive quoted Steve Jobs saying about ideas: “I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas can ultimately become so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts. So easily compromised, so easily missed, so easily just squished.”

Ideas are the product of the unconscious thought process.

—

The formation of ideas by unconscious thought is a process as fragile as it is powerful, and as easy to attain as it is difficult to master.

Indeed, such formation of ideas is akin to building a castle of cards, that a simple gust of wind can topple. All it takes to interrupt the formation of the idea is a jarring perception. An external stimulus that could not be unconsciously processed.

In the unconscious, incredibly many notions are compared at the same time, but only one thread is being woven. The unconscious can only weave one thread of ideas at a time. This weaving is autonomously done by the unconscious. The only role of the conscious is to protect it. The conscious must protect the work of the unconscious by prohibiting the formation of ideas incompatible with the current thread of thought being woven. This is akin to the work of he who distills liquor, synthesises compounds. The purity of the process is the single greatest multiplying factor for the end quality of the product.

The conscious, when confronted with an incompatible idea, must weave either into a compatible idea, or out of the working memory, as quickly and as efficiently as possible so as to preserve the purity of the unconscious thought process. 

What are incompatible ideas ?

> Excessively early self-criticism
> The feeling of being watched
> Interfering perceptions of meaning
-> Interfering speech (chatter, music lyrics)
-> Interfering sights (clutter

There is also an obligation of radiality. The process of writing is conventionally linear, but the unconscious process is deeply non-linear. It is radial. It does not roll straight like a train, it leaps around like a rabbit. It flies around like a bee, tasting from each flower its nectar of ideas. It must be followed and tracked, and to do so requires both proper tooling and proper training.

Proper tooling

Proper training

> Recognising that the unconscious will only open doors and follow the paths that it wishes. It is the most powerful optimisation algorithm that has ever run in the universe. It will sometimes open a door and say “This path deserves to be explored, but I am headed to a higher potential path.” It snakes its way through the field of ideas like an electric arc. You have the choice to follow it or judge it, and when you judge it, you slow it down with interfering ideas.

You must decide when to follow and when to cristallise, and you must know that you should always err on the side of following when you are not convinced. If you are not positively convinced by the idea you just had, it means that the thread is not complete. It can take minutes, days, or years.

The most powerful change that you will notice after transitioning to the unconscious, is your capacity for work. It will undergo an explosion and turn you into the most focused and driven person you have ever known. But it will also make you oddly impatient and reclusive. For what others mistake as impatience or reclusiveness is simply the more strong-armed attempts of your conscious to serve as rightful guardian of unconscious.

The unconscious is fragile. And yet it is so powerful.

This realisation is a secret, but not an ordinary secret, not one protected through ego, fear or greed. Like all great theories of thought, in Science and in Philosophy, it is protected by the goddess of Knowledge and its messengers, Study, Practice and Mindfulness. The only path to the omnipotence of the unconscious is through Knowledge, which itself is attained through Study, Practice and Mindfulness.

Study plants the seeds. Practice pours the water. Mindfulness shines the Sun.

Then you protect the plant as it grows, knowing well that the best protection will yield the best plant, but that the longer you protect, the longer you have to defend your consciousness from forming incompatible thoughts. Which is why the greatest ideas need a voluntary and prolonged retreat to be born.

The process is organic and its results are industrial.
The process is irrational and its results are rational.

The cause is the organic process of the unconscious.
The effect is the physical movement and the spoken word, to both materialise and propagate ideas.

The Master Key System is the real deal. It is no fucking joke. And you call tell those who know, whether they found and read it — achieving the early-age success environment of the Silicon Valley — or whether they understood it through life experience, generally succeeding later in life.

And I used to think that work was conscious. That all my life my work would have to result of conscious, draining effort, while I consigned my moments of ecstatic reverie to my eccentric hobbies. This is what is thought at school. Through this new lens, it would seem that school’s only goal is to anaesthetise the unconscious, so that other entities may profit from what is essentially slave labor: the work of a man that has turned his back to his unconscious.

Throughout society, unconsciousness is actively anaesthetised, stigmatised, in both its causes and effects. Causes, because meditation is largely ignored and psychedelics are largely banned. Effects, because the Humanities and the Arts are at the bottom of the educational-industrial feeding chain.

—

The methods of inducing and protecting unconscious thought are largely trivialised and stigmatised, sometimes by truly lost people, and sometimes by those who once saw and then got lost again, and grew depressed, bitter and jealous.

—

The most important skills you can learn are those that induce and those that protect the process of unconscious thought, by monitoring and protecting its purity, by forbidding incompatible ideas from entering or staying too long.

—

Then there are the Greater Skills, one of which is the ability to follow and cristallise unconscious thought in real-time, either in music, in speech, in writing or in other, less verbal modes of communication, that is the mark of a true artist.

See Dali for his method of inducing unconscious thought.
See Terence McKenna for his ability to cristallise in real-time.

Another Greater Skill is the ability to induce unconscious thought in an increasingly voluntary manner. This is attained by extending the ability to control conscious thought, to the point that it can voluntarily dissipate it: Mindfulness, Meditation, the ability to identify and manage Distractions.

Distractions are incompatible thoughts that must be made compatible or discarded before they contaminate the unconscious thought process. Sometimes, incompatible thoughts of a certain type arrive with regularity, because they originate from an external source. This external source of incompatible thoughts is a Distraction.

—

Those who specialise in the ability to induce thought soon realise that there is no such thing, and that what is perceived as the creation of a novel thought, is simply detecting the birth of a particularly interesting thread of unconscious thought and putting in place the proper measures of protection and cristallisation. They understand that this can happen anytime, which is why you recognise them at the notepad that they always carry with them, be it analog or digital.

There are actually many very strong resonances between these ideas and the ideas expressed in Jony Ive’s speech about Steve Jobs. “And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and wonderful reverence. (…) I loved the way he listened so intently."

Unsurprisingly, Steve Jobs had understood, as is seen in his many other quotes. “You can only connect the dots looking backwards.” There, he acknowledged that the unconscious has its own path and the best the conscious can do is facilitate it, not predict it.

Jobs and Ive had also understood the source of ultimate creative power: the intertwining of two unconsciouses towards a common goal. (“Spiritual partner.” - “Closest and most loyal friend.”) If “unconsciouses” seems so unwieldy, it’s because it is incorrect if there simply two occurrences of the all-encompassing, omnipotent consciousness as described by Haanel.

— 

What is also surprising is that describing it in such grandiose terms does not feel at all like an exaggeration. The words are as inevitable as the unconscious thought is unpredictable. Follow it, or fail. Protect it, or perish.

—

I now understood why it is called The Master Key System. The name is as odd, a priori, as it is apt, a posteriori. Inevitable, yet unpredictable. Unconsciously attained.
