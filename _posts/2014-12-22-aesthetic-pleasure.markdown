Beauty such as the architecture of cities or an arrangement of flowers is achieved by following certain unwritten general rules such as the color of roofs, the color of bricks, the general aspect of bridges, while allowing free expression within these constraints: shape, ridges, ornamentation. 

The pleasure of beauty is derived by the discovery of these rules, that tie together the apparent complexity into a cogent, yet abstract, order. 

Knowledge of prior rules and their taxonomic heritage is then a good asset to increase rule perception and thus aesthetic pleasure.
